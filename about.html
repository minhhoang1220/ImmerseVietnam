                            In the early days of February 2024, after consulting with many international friends, we
                            realized that they chose Vietnam as a study abroad destination partly because of its wild
                            beauty and majestic nature. This is completely understandable because Vietnam's location and
                            climate are very suitable for experiencing, exploring and relaxing activities. According to the statistics from
                            Google Destination Insights, the number of international searches for Vietnam tourism is growing by about 50 - 75% in 2024, the 4th highest
                            increase in the world. "I feel surprised and excited when admiring the beauty of the mountains on the seas of Vietnam. They help me see
                            how wonderful nature really is" - is what a friend from Russia told us.

                            an option to explore among the countless wonders of the world. We joined hands to build an
